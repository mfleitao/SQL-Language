-- *****************************

-- Types of Queries
-- TABULAR - Returns a table with columns and rows
-- LIST    - Single Column, multiple Rows
-- SCALAR  - Returns a single value

-- SCALAR EXAMPLE:
-- What was the most goals scored in one game by a single player..
SELECT max(NumGoals) AS "Max Goals"
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers;
    -- we see the answer was 5
-- which player or players scored 5
SELECT playerID
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
    WHERE NumGoals = 5;
-- we see 4 results, but 1 was a duplicate, meaning the same player scored 5 goals twice
SELECT DISTINCT playerID
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
    WHERE NumGoals = 5;
-- no hard coding, we need to find out the 5 on the fly

SELECT DISTINCT playerID
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
    WHERE NumGoals = 
        (
        SELECT max(NumGoals) 
            FROM tbldatgoalscorers
        );
   -- proof of yesterday, today and tomorrow
UPDATE tbldatgoalscorers SET NumGoals = 6 WHERE goalID = 12;
        -- rerun statement, now only get 1 results....prooving tomorrow works.
UPDATE tbldatgoalscorers SET NumGoals = 5 WHERE goalID = 12;

-- we want names
SELECT namefirst, namelast, playerid
    FROM tbldatplayers
    WHERE playerid IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT playerID
            FROM tbldatgoalscorers
            WHERE NumGoals = 
                (
                SELECT max(NumGoals) 
                    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
                )
        );
